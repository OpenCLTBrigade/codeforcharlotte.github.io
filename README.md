# CodeForCharlotte

This project is for easily ramping up with the technologies that you will need to become a successful contributor for CodeForCharlotte.

* **Curated by CodeForCharlotte** While there are many resources available online, we have identified those that we believe align the closest with our technologies and provide the most value.

* **Open for Contribution** This site welcomes contributions. Documentation is a great way to start out contributing to an open source project. If there are areas of improvement that can be made we welcome the feedback.
